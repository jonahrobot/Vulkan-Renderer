		If I could have some struct in my renderer.h that defines what data I want, and what shader I want it
		
		Then we create a descriptor set matching that information?? So it is not hidden inside of the DescriptorSet.cpp

		No hard coding data types would be nice!

		Then we need some like promise system that checks for data buffers creation and updating in descriptors!
